## Asakatsu-Website

A project where you can keep track of your goal's progress, and contribute to open source in the same time.

AsaKatsu is a Japanese term for waking up a little early to do something productive, in line with a goal. For example; read 4 books per month, do 100 days challenge, etc.

In this project, everyone who will commit will have to do a thing or two every morning and log the progress here.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asakatsuOrg/Asakatsu-Website.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Asakatsu-Website repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd Asakatsu-Website
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```bash
git switch -c my-branch
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

<!-- Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file. -->

If you want to join, add your name in Profile.json file.

- add your details in `Profile.json` file

File location:
`./Profile.json`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99729607/196917580-27379a0d-f94d-476b-b2cb-ac4a4417d14a.png)

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push origin -u my-branch
```

replacing `my-branch` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
